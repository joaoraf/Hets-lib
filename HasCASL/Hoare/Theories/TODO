* Sort out the definitions and theorems over appropriate files:
   - MoandSyntax.thy: everything, conserning pure monads,
   - MultimonadSyntax.thy: everything, that essentialy uses nondeterminism,
   - KleeneSyntax.thy: only the constructions, which use iteration.
* Check, whether ^[*] can serve a basis for ^[+] rather then the way around,
  and, if so, implement it.
* Change the encoding of the pointful metalanguage through the pointfree one,
  and, maybe, change the syntax of it.

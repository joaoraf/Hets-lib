not done

several specs have eternal objects in source

129 (your imported model didn't confirm cons, so did it by hand)

150 (some errors with xas that I dont get)

164 (probably solved)

175 (solved with eternal object in source)

194 (clearly not cons)

202 (similar to 194)

220 (check syntax)

236 (similar to 175, but new sort is extension of subsort) - goes through, with eternal PED

244 (similar to 175, but no new sort at all) goes through with eternal PD

265 (check syntax) (there was bug in Hets not checking cons correctly)

273 check, should be OK

298 nothing there?

315 looks impossible to my innocent eye... what does (var x : TL) do?

330 taxonomy: what's to do?

DONE

129 (your imported model didn't confirm cons, so did it by hand)
164 (probably solved) yes!
194 (clearly not cons) now done; two eternal objects
175 (solved with eternal object in source)
202 (similar to 194): done, one eternal SAG
236 (similar to 175, but new sort is extension of subsort) - goes through, with eternal PED
244 (similar to 175, but no new sort at all) goes through with eternal PD

-> 265 (check syntax) (there was bug in Hets not checking cons correctly)

273 check, should be OK

NOT DONE

-> 150 (some errors with xas that I dont get) that's a hard one...

-> 220 (check) timeout!

-> 298 nothing there? leave out? (not put on anonymous website)

-> 315 looks impossible to my innocent eye... what does (var x : TL) do?
(var x : TL) is the same as x. need new theory of qt/dqt?

-> 330 taxonomy: what's to do? subsorts of PD need to be introduced earlier

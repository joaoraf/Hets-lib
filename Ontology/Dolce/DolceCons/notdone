Eternal objects

25:  SC

37:  SAG

56:  F

79:  APO

175: NPED

194: NAPO, 
	 M

202: SAG

236: PED

244: PD

PED and NPED are implied

not done

129 (your imported model didn't confirm cons, so did it by hand)

-> 150 (some errors with xas that I dont get) that's a hard one...

164 (probably solved) yes!

175 (solved with eternal object in source)

194 (clearly not cons) now done; two eternal objects

202 (similar to 194): done, one eternal SAG

-> 220 (check)

236 (similar to 175, but new sort is extension of subsort) - goes through, with eternal PED

244 (similar to 175, but no new sort at all) goes through with eternal PD

265 (check syntax) (there was bug in Hets not checking cons correctly)

273 check, should be OK

298 nothing there?

-> 315 looks impossible to my innocent eye... what does (var x : TL) do?

330 taxonomy: what's to do?
